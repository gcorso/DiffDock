## How to use this space

This is a simple app intended to showcase [DiffDock](https://github.com/gcorso/DiffDock).
One can upload a protein and ligand, and calculate the predicted structure. The results are visualized in 3D and can be downloaded.

* This app is designed to take 1 protein (in PDB format) and 1 ligand (in SDF format) at a time. For bulk inference, use the [command line interface](https://github.com/gcorso/DiffDock).

* Our demonstration space uses a CPU, so it may take a few minutes to run. For faster results, use a GPU. 
One can duplicate this space (at their own expense) by selecting "⋮" -> "Duplicate this space" in the top right corner, and then selecting a GPU in the "Settings" tab.
